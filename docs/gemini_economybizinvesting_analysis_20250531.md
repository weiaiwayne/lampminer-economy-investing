3.  **What stood out to you the most from today’s posts?**

    "The news about Trump wanting to double tariffs on foreign steel is what really caught my attention. I'm worried it will make everything more expensive, from cars to washing machines. Also, the post about Palantir creating a master database is pretty scary. It feels like our privacy is being eroded more and more."

    *   "How will doubling the steel tariffs actually help American workers, and what are you doing to protect us from the inevitable price increases?

5.  **Based on what you’ve seen, what do you think is next for the U.S. economy?**

    "Honestly, it's hard to say. It feels like there are a lot of conflicting forces at play. Tariffs could raise prices, and there’s always uncertainty around elections. I'm not sure what the future holds."
