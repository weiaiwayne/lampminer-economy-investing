**3. Perspective of an Average U.S. Consumer: What stood out to you the most?**

"That side hustles article really hit home. It feels like everyone's scrambling to make ends meet, even people with 'good' jobs. Also, that tariff stuff is worrying. It's like prices are already high enough, and now they might get even worse? And on a completely different note, the person trying to open a drinks-focused cafe in a residential area sounds like a great addition to the neighborhood!"

**4. Perspective of an Average U.S. Consumer: What questions would you want to ask the politicians?**

*   "What are you *actually* doing to help lower inflation and make things more affordable for working families? Saying you're 'working on it' isn't enough anymore."
*   "How are you planning to help people who are being displaced by AI and automation? Retraining programs? Universal Basic Income? What's the plan?"
*   "Why are tariffs still in place when they are raising prices for American consumers?"

**5. Perspective of an Average U.S. Consumer: Based on what youâ€™ve seen, what do you think is next for the U.S. economy?**

"It feels like things are going to stay tough for a while. Prices aren't going down anytime soon, and job security is shaky. People are going to keep relying on side hustles, and hopefully, some of these small businesses being started actually make it. I think the economy will grow but that the average person will not benefit much as inequality grows."

**6. Perspective of an Experienced Investment Advisor: Top tips for someone looking to invest in the stock market right now?**

*   **Dollar-Cost Averaging:** "Given the uncertainty, invest a fixed amount regularly (e.g., monthly) rather than trying to time the market. This helps smooth out the impact of volatility."
*   **Diversify, Diversify, Diversify:** "Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different sectors, asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate), and geographies."
*   **Focus on Long-Term Value:** "Look for companies with strong fundamentals, a history of profitability, and a sustainable competitive advantage. Don't chase fads or meme stocks."
*   **Consider Defensive Stocks:** "In an uncertain economic climate, consider investing in companies that provide essential goods and services that people will continue to need regardless of economic conditions."
*   **Be Mindful of Tariffs & International Exposure:** "If you're investing in companies with significant international operations, be aware of the potential impact of tariffs and trade disputes."
*   **Don't Panic:** "Market corrections are normal. Stay calm, avoid emotional decisions, and stick to your long-term investment plan."
*   **Seek Professional Advice:** "Consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor who can help you create a personalized investment strategy based on your individual goals and risk tolerance."
*   **Stay Informed:** "Keep up with economic news and market trends, but be wary of hype and misinformation. Rely on credible sources of information."
