3.  **What stood out to you the most from today’s posts?**

    "The tariffs are what hit me hard. I'm not a business owner, but everything costs more now, and it seems like it’s just getting worse. Also, the post about the SBA loan issues is concerning. If the government is messing around with loans they already gave out, what does that mean for the rest of us? It makes me nervous about the future."

    *   **Focus on long-term value:** Avoid chasing short-term gains or "hot" stocks. Invest in companies with strong fundamentals, solid business models, and a track record of consistent growth.
    *   **Consider defensive sectors:** In times of uncertainty, sectors like utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples tend to hold up better. These are essential services people need regardless of the economic climate.
    *   **Stay informed, but avoid panic:** Keep up with market news, but don't let fear or greed drive your decisions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid making impulsive moves based on short-term market fluctuations.
    *   **Seek professional advice:** If you're unsure where to start, consult with a qualified financial advisor. They can help you develop a personalized investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
    *   **Dollar-Cost Averaging:** Consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the market price. This strategy, called dollar-cost averaging, can help you reduce risk and potentially increase your returns over time.
