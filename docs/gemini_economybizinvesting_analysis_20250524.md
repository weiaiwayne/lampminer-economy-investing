**Consumer Perspective**

3.  **What stood out to you the most from today’s posts?**

    *   The post about turning social media traffic into sales for the ammo/weapon accessories business really stood out. It's frustrating to see someone putting in the effort to create content but not seeing the sales follow through. I also found the concerns about privacy when filing business paperwork interesting. The business owner worried about being copied makes me think that it's hard to come up with something new and interesting.
4.  **What questions would you want to ask the politicians?**

    *   Given the court's decision on international students, what specific measures are being considered to balance national security concerns with attracting and retaining talented individuals who contribute to our economy and innovation? Also, what is being done to support small businesses and e-commerce owners struggling to convert online engagement into tangible sales, especially considering the rising costs of advertising and increasing competition?
5.  **Based on what you’ve seen, what do you think is next for the U.S. economy?**

    *   I think we'll continue to see a competitive e-commerce landscape, where businesses will need to be more creative and strategic to stand out. The economy is still strong, but it will be difficult to stay competitive.

**Investment Advisor Perspective**

6.  **What are your top tips for someone looking to invest in the stock market right now?**

    *   **Diversify:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different sectors, asset classes, and geographies to mitigate risk.
    *   **Focus on the long term:** Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Investing is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay focused on your long-term financial goals.
    *   **Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy:** Invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. This helps to reduce the impact of volatility and can lead to better average returns over time.
    *   **Do your research:** Understand the companies or funds you're investing in. Look at their financials, competitive landscape, and growth potential.
    *   **Seek professional advice:** If you're unsure where to start or need help managing your portfolio, consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor. They can help you develop a personalized investment strategy based on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon.
