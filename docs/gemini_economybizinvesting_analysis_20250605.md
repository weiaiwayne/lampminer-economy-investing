3.  **What stood out to you the most from today’s posts?**
    *   "The small business owner who can't get any visibility even after doing everything 'right' on social media. It makes you realize how hard it is for those people to actually succeed when the algorithms are stacked against them."

4.  **What questions would you want to ask the politicians?**
    *   "How are you actually helping small businesses survive and compete with big corporations? Are you even aware of how difficult it is to get started without significant capital? How will rising costs of postage and tariffs affect the average person?"

    *   "I'm worried about more price increases, especially on everyday items. It feels like the government isn't doing enough to protect consumers and small businesses from inflation and monopolies. We might be headed for a recession if things don't improve for small businesses, because they're so important to our communities."

6.  **What are your top tips for someone looking to invest in the stock market right now?**

    *   **Diversify, diversify, diversify:** "Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different sectors, industries, and asset classes to mitigate risk."

    *   **Consider a low-cost index fund:** "For beginners, investing in a broad market index fund (like the S&P 500) is a simple and effective way to gain exposure to the market without having to pick individual stocks. Choose funds with low expense ratios."

    *   **Invest for the long term:** "Don't try to time the market. Focus on long-term growth rather than short-term gains. The stock market can be volatile in the short run, but historically, it has provided good returns over the long run."

    *   **Don't panic sell:** "If the market dips, don't panic and sell your investments. Market downturns are a normal part of investing, and trying to time the market can lead to missed opportunities."

    *   **Seek professional advice (if needed):** "If you're not comfortable making investment decisions on your own, consult with a qualified financial advisor who can help you develop a personalized investment strategy. There is no shame in asking for help, and in fact that shows wisdom."
