*   **What stood out to you the most from today’s posts?**

    "It's tough out there for small business owners. I see so many people struggling to get their businesses off the ground, and it makes me wonder if I should even try to start something myself. The posts about the cost of living, work-life balance, and finding the right marketing strategies resonate with me."

*   **Based on what you’ve seen, what do you think is next for the U.S. economy?**

    "It feels uncertain. There's a lot of innovation happening, but there's also a lot of anxiety about the economy. I think we'll see more people starting side hustles and small businesses, but it will be harder than ever to succeed without the right resources and support. There will be winners and losers."
