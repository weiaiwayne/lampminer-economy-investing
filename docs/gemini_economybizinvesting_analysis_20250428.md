Okay, here's a summary of the Reddit posts and responses from the perspectives of a consumer and an investment advisor:

**3. From the Perspective of an Average U.S. Consumer:**

*   **What stood out to you the most from today’s posts?**

"All this talk about tariffs is worrying. It sounds like things are going to get more expensive, and I'm already struggling to keep up with the cost of living. Also, that poor teenager trying to start a business – it's sad to see how complicated it is to just mail a package. And the person selling their cafe chain because they're exhausted – that makes me wonder if anyone can really succeed in small business these days."

*   **What questions would you want to ask the politicians?**

"What are you *really* doing to protect American consumers from rising prices due to these tariffs? And what are you doing to support small businesses so they don't go under and take jobs with them? And can you PLEASE explain these tariffs in a way that a normal person can understand? It feels like you're gambling with my family's future."

*   **Based on what you’ve seen, what do you think is next for the U.S. economy?**

"Honestly, it feels like things are going to get worse before they get better. Prices will keep going up, and it'll be harder for small businesses to stay afloat. I'm worried about a recession and losing my job. I'm going to try to save as much as I can and be careful with my spending."

**4. From the Perspective of an Experienced Investment Advisor:**

*   **What are your top tips for someone looking to invest in the stock market right now?**

"The current market is filled with uncertainty, so proceed with caution. Here are my top tips:

    1.  **Diversify, Diversify, Diversify:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different sectors and asset classes. Look at value, growth, small cap, and large cap.
    2.  **Focus on Long-Term Value:** Don't chase quick gains. Invest in companies with strong fundamentals, solid balance sheets, and a proven track record of growth, not just the trending stocks of the moment.
    3.  **Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging:** Invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market's performance. This can help mitigate risk and average out your purchase price.
    4.  **Review Your Risk Tolerance:** Be honest with yourself about how much risk you're comfortable taking. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
    5.  **Don't Panic Sell:** Market corrections are normal. Avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Stay the course and focus on your long-term goals.
    6.  **Seek Professional Advice:** If you're unsure where to start, consult with a qualified financial advisor who can help you develop a personalized investment strategy."
