**Perspective of an Average U.S. Consumer:**

**3. What stood out to you the most from today’s posts?**

"The thing that really sticks with me is the talk about automation and AI. It's cool and all, but the thought that jobs might disappear because of it is scary. Also, the news about tariffs being removed but then potentially coming back just makes everything feel unstable. It's hard to plan when you don't know what prices are going to do."

**4. What questions would you want to ask the politicians?**

*   "What are you doing to prepare workers for the jobs that might be lost to automation? Are there retraining programs or support for people who need to switch careers?"
*   "What's your long-term plan for trade? Is it all about tariffs, or are you working towards fair deals that benefit everyone?"
*   "What are you doing to ensure the economy is stable and that everyday folks aren't hurt by these trade and technological changes?"

**5. Based on what you’ve seen, what do you think is next for the U.S. economy?**

"I think things are going to be bumpy. There's a lot of uncertainty, with potential trade wars and automation looming. Companies doing well right now, like Nvidia, might be riding high, but it's hard to say if that will last. I think prices are going to keep fluctuating. I just hope that workers get the support they need to adapt to these changes."

**Perspective of an Experienced Investment Advisor:**

**6. What are your top tips for someone looking to invest in the stock market right now?**

*   **Diversify, diversify, diversify:** "Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different sectors and asset classes to reduce risk. This is especially important given the current economic climate."
*   **Consider long-term growth opportunities:** "Look at sectors like technology and AI, but be selective. Companies like Nvidia are leading the way, but do your research before investing. Also, invest in real estate so you will not be dependent on a company for income."
*   **Be cautious with high-risk assets:** "Be wary of get-rich-quick schemes or unproven strategies. Always do your due diligence and understand the risks involved before investing."
*   **Stay informed, but don't panic:** "Keep up with economic news, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on market volatility. Focus on your long-term investment goals and adjust your strategy as needed."
*   **Consult with a financial professional:** "Get personalized advice based on your individual financial situation and risk tolerance. A financial advisor can help you develop a sound investment strategy and navigate the complexities of the market."
