**3. From the Perspective of an Average U.S. Consumer:**

*   **What stood out to you the most from today’s posts?**
    "Honestly, how confusing everything is! One minute we have these big tariffs, then they're gone, then they're maybe coming back on something else? It's hard to know if the stuff I buy is going to get more expensive or not. Also, it's scary to see so many people worried about a recession."

*   **What questions would you want to ask the politicians?**
    *   "Can you PLEASE make up your minds about these tariffs? What is the actual long-term plan here, and how will it affect *my* budget?
    *   Are we headed for a recession, and what are you doing to prevent it? Be honest!
    *   Why is it so difficult for small businesses to get off the ground and succeed in this economy?"

*   **Based on what you’ve seen, what do you think is next for the U.S. economy?**
    "I'm worried things will get more expensive, and I'm not sure my paycheck will keep up. I think we're going to see more ups and downs in the market, and it's going to be hard for the average person to know what to do with their money. I am afraid that things will not improve as the government keeps going back and forth with regulations."

**4. From the Perspective of an Experienced Investment Advisor:**

*   **What are your top tips for someone looking to invest in the stock market right now?**
